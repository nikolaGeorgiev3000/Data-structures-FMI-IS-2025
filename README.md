## 🧠 How We Work
After each seminar:

2. Solve 2–3 practice tasks in `/tasks/week-X/`
3. Link related LeetCode problems in `/leetcode/week-X/`

## 🧰 Environment
- macOS Tahoe  
- Cursor/VSCode IDE  
- C++ (primary language)

## 🚀 Next Step
Wait for the first lecture & seminar — once available,  
we’ll populate `week-1` and start the theory breakdown process.
